# Analysis of the spread of Covid-19 in Chile

### About this project
Just like most countries, Chile is also affected by the spread of Covid-19. The hotspot seems to be clearly Chiles capital Santiago de Chile. Using a uncommon approach, the Chilean government applied lockdown policies only in specific parts of the city (so-called comunas). Therefore, the lockdown started in some of the eastern districts. 

However, many inhabitants of the city have to travel through the whole city, e.g. vendors which enter the city from the outskirts. 

My questions are: 
* Is the "Chilean lockdown approach" succesful in containing Covid-19? 
* Does the "Chilean lockdown approach" make any difference? 

Of course it has to be noted that I only can work with the official data. 


### Data sources
Data on Covid-19 can be found through the websites of the Chilean government as well as on GitHub, which is very useful:  
* General GitHub repo: https://github.com/MinCiencia/Datos-COVID19/
* GitHub repo with data that I used: https://github.com/MinCiencia/Datos-COVID19/tree/master/output/producto1
